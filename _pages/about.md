I work at [Theori](https://theori.io) as AI researcher, studying cybersecurity and building stuff with LLMs.  
Previously, I have scratched the surface of competitive programming, CTFs, and computer vision.

My nickname is named after the Formula 1 driver [Kimi Raikkonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen).

My unnecessarily long list of hobbies include bouldering, Japanese Majhong, rhythm games, aespa concerts, and drinking alcohol.
